\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

As part of this thesis work we have developed the Model Abstraction Framework.  This modeling framework is based on the concept of directed role graphs and directed team graphs and is capable of modeling complex human machine systems as labeled state transition systems.  We have shown that the Model Abstraction Framework is extremely flexible, allowing each portion of a system to be modeled at varying levels of abstraction.  This allows us to model system components without knowing the implementation details.  We demonstrated this in the UAV Enabled Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) case study when we found flaws in the Video Operator role which were previously undocumented and again in the Unmanned Aerial System integration into the National Airspace System case study when we demonstrated the effect of automating a portion of the UAV Operator duties.  

Additionally we have demonstrated our ability to perform model checking directly on the Model Abstraction Framework models using Java Pathfinder (JPF).  With this tool we were able to explore multiple paths through our WiSAR model to find those paths which lead to critical failure.  With the ability to perform model checking directly on our models coupled with the flexibility of our modeling language and our ability to extract workload metrics we have the basis of an extremely powerful modeling tool.

We demonstrated the ability to implement an XML model parser to facilitate more efficient modeling.  While the improvement the XML provided was not as great as we had hoped this does demonstrate the ability to adapt to more efficient methods of modeling.  One area of future work is to implement conversion classes between our modeling language and some of the other more popular modeling languages such as Brahms or EOFM which would give us additional validation options ~\cite{bolton2013litreview}.

Finally we have demonstrated the ability to extract workload metrics which are consistent with known high workload events and closely related to human workload theories such as Multiple Resource Theory, Threaded Cognition Theory, and Operator fan-out~\cite{wickens2002multiple, salvucci2008threaded, cummings2007predicting}.  We are encouraged by the predicted workload reduction seen in our second case study which segues into the future of this work.

\section{Future Work}

The ultimate goal of this work is to create a UAS for WiSAR which allows a single human to perform all of the necessary tasks.  Before this can be accomplished using the Model Abstraction Framework the workload metrics need to be verified through sensitivity and user studies, currently being pursued by other researchers.  We anticipate that machine learning algorithms will be able to take data from these to produce a set of weightings which can be applied to the individual workload metrics.  Once the workload metrics have settled the next step is to polish up the WiSAR model, add performance measurement Actors, and systematically modify the model to find a single human design which satisfies the performance measurements and maintains workload below a certain threshold.  The next step after completing the WiSAR model is to create a generic UAS model which can then be used to explore the effects of novel UAS GUI designs.

In relation to the future of the Model Abstraction Framework there are several avenues of future work which we feel would be the most beneficial.  The first is improvements to the modeling process.  We see this happening in several ways; new language structures which improve the ability to visualize the model, conversion classes which take advantage of existing language structures to generate models for our framework, or extending another modeling language such as Brahms or EOFM to work in a similar fashion.

Another avenue of future work is to establish a verification framework to facilitate the model checking process.  One way we see this working is to allow the models to specify metric thresholds, Actor-specific performance measurements, and dynamic portions of the model.  The verification framework then uses machine learning to iteratively change the dynamic portions of the model to find an optimized design.
